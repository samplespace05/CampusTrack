    <h1>About This Portal</h1>
    <p>
        Welcome to the NITW Campus Lost & Found portal. This platform is dedicated to helping the NITW community reunite with their lost belongings.
    </p>
    <h2>How It Works</h2>
    <p>
        Simply register for an account and log in. If you've lost an item, you can post a "Lost" listing with details and a picture. If you've found something, you can post a "Found" listing to help it find its owner.
    </p>
    <p>
        Browse the listings, use the search and filter tools to narrow down results, and claim any item that belongs to you. Our system will notify the original poster so you can coordinate the return.
    </p>
